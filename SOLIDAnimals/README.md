# SOLID Animals Project

## Overview

The SOLID Animals Project is an educational project designed to help developers learn and understand the SOLID principles through a fun and engaging example involving animals. This project serves as a learning tool for both the author and the community, providing a gentle and adorable way to grasp these fundamental software design principles.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. They are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Project Structure

The project is structured to demonstrate these principles through various classes and interfaces representing different animals and their behaviors.

### Domain

- **Animal**: The base class for all animals, containing common properties like `Name`, `Species` and `Age`.
- **Dog**, **Cat**, **Bird**: Derived classes representing specific types of animals.

### Interfaces

- **ISound**: An interface for animals that can make sounds.
- **IFlyable**: An interface for animals that can fly.

### Services

- **AnimalService**: A service class responsible for managing a list of animals, including adding, removing, and interacting with them.

### Controllers

- **AnimalsController**: A controller class providing API endpoints to interact with the animals.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Build the Project**: Open the project in Visual Studio and build it to restore dependencies and compile the code.
3. **Run the Tests**: Execute the unit tests to ensure everything is working as expected.
4. **Explore the Code**: Review the code to understand how the SOLID principles are applied.

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, you will learn:

- How to apply the SOLID principles in a practical scenario.
- How to design flexible and maintainable software.
- How to use interfaces and abstract classes to achieve polymorphism.
- How to write unit tests to verify the behavior of your code.
